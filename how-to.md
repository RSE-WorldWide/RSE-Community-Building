# How to contribute

In here we will add instructions on how to contribute to this book.
Documents are edited in MarkDown.
For the moment editing will have to be done as follows, assuming that you will be entering changes using the GitHub interface:

- Make sure you are on the `main` branch. 
Anything done on the `gh-branch` will be deleted when an automated update is done.
- From the GitHub [RSE-WorldWide/RSE-Community-Building](https://github.com/RSE-WorldWide/RSE-Community-Building) web page, click on the file you want to edit. 
For the moment there are only two pages, `index.md` and `how-to.md`.
- To the right hand side of the window there is a pencil icon, click on that to edit the file.
- Make your changes to the file - remember we are using MarkDown.
- When done, click on the big green button: `Commit changes...`
- Add a very short commit message that says what you have done.
- There is a space for an extended description where you can add more information if you want to.
- Click the green button `Propose changes`
- We will receive a message that you have made changes which we will then review and accept once everyone is happy with the changes.

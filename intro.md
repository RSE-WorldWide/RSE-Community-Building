# Welcome

**Welcome to the *International RSE Community Building handbook.**

*The International RSE Community Building handbook* is an international project to encourage more successful community building in research software engineering through sharing what works and sometimes more interestingly, what doesnâ€™t.  We encourage and welcome all contributors from around the world to join us and add community building efforts at a local, regional, national or international level.  Our goal is to provide a handbook for everyone, whether new to community building or expert, that shows how varied community building can be and importantly how diverse it is in different countries.
